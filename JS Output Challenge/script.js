I used to play soccer but I stopped playing soccer in highschool because everyone took it too serious and I just thought of it as a funny game to play when I was bored at home I got to play for 9 years so I got my fun out of it.I found out that I may be a little Autophobic sometimes but that is something I need to work on."

I'm not really thinking about the future but I think I should really sit down and think about it one of these years. Most people disagree with me but I don't think of myself as a even remotely smart people but my teachers all disagree with me but I think its just because it's their job to at least try to be nice and encourage us a little bit but I think they should be a little more straightforward in highschool but they decide to sugar coat a lot of what they then they say that you suddenly decide what your doing with your life because the school tells them to more or less 'play nice with the kids and teach them all of the stuff to pass' but than at least some tell you how it is but they normally get fired or in trouble."
